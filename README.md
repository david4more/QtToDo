## Possible improvements

  - notifications
  - mobile version, synchronization
  - use database instead of .json
  - expected time spent + Pomodoro tracking
  - subtasks
  - parsing and conversion from .txt
  - language processing (naming task "celebrate bd monday" will add the task on next monday)
